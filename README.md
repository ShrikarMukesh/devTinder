## Difference between `^` (caret) and `~` (tilde) in package.json versions

In `package.json`, the `^` (caret) and `~` (tilde) symbols specify how npm should update package versions:

- **Caret (`^`)**  
  Example: `"express": "^4.17.1"`

  - Allows updates that do not change the first non-zero digit (major version).
  - Updates to any minor or patch version: `4.x.x` (but not `5.0.0`).

- **Tilde (`~`)**  
  Example: `"express": "~4.17.1"`
  - Allows updates to the patch version only.
  - Updates to `4.17.x` (but not `4.18.0`).

**Summary:**

- `^` = Accepts minor and patch updates
- `~` = Accepts

## What is the use of nodemon?

**nodemon** is a tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server when file changes in the directory are detected. This saves time during development, as you don't need to manually stop and restart your server after making changes to your code.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
npm install mongoose
